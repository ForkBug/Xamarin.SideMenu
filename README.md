Xamarin.SideMenu
===================================

This is a port of the [SideMenu](https://github.com/jonkykong/SideMenu) library for Unified Xamarin.iOS

So many thanks to [@jonkykong](https://github.com/jonkykong) for the great library


## Overview

SideMenu is a simple and versatile side menu control written in c#.
* Four standard animation styles to choose from (even parallax if you want to get weird).
* Highly customizable without needing to write tons of custom code.
* Supports continuous swiping between side menus on boths sides in a single gesture.
* Global menu configuration. Set-up once and be done for all screens.
* Menus can be presented and dismissed the same as any other View Controller since this control uses custom transitions.
